# Still to do:

1) Finish README
2) Uploaded updated .fzpz files
    * Updated breadboard
    * Updated circuit
3) Add another INTURRUPT pin
4) Readjust the pinout so...
    * Encoder0 = Main = Top position
    * Encoder1 = Chrome = Middle position
    * Encoder2 = Game = Bottom position
5) Take and upload photos of...
    * Outside of the enclosure...
        - Front
        - Back
        - Bottom
    * Inside of the enclosure...
        - Logitech PCB 
            * Potentiometer rewiring
            * Power switch/LED rewiring
        - Resistor breakout board
        - Arduino
6) Replace the current 'mute state' LEDs; they appear to have burnt out or something, I cannot get them working, even with a voltmeter
    * Ensure that they actually turn on when the corresponding encoder's push button is pressed
7) Correct the button bounce issue
    * Will likey need to include a bounce library
8) Edit the AHK scripts
    * Change suspend to disable
    * Reintroduce mute function to the TOP of all the scripts
9) Fix the SOURCE and DISABLE buttons; currently unplugged inside the box due to button bounce issue
10) Debug the finalized project
11) Carbon vinyl over the face plate
12) Take a video of the working project
    * Upload to YouTube
